<p> In this task we will work with multithreading.</p>

<p> To solve this task we need:

# Q & A

*<p> Why we use loguru instead of
the built-in logging module? </p>*

- No Handler, no Formatter, no Filter:
  one function to rule them all
- Easier file logging with rotation / retention / compression
- Modern string formatting using braces style
- Exceptions catching within threads or main
- Pretty logging with colors
- Fully descriptive exceptions
- Better datetime handling
- Entirely compatible with standard logging
- 10x faster than built-in logging

# Functional requirements

- Fix troubles with GIL

- Install python3, if missing
  https://www.python.org/downloads/.
